> If you are an Ember Data user, I have created a specific renderer that output JSON compliant payload. I didn't
released it yet as it's not really clean, but if you're interested, please contact me :).

## Installation

Install the module by typing (or add it to your `composer.json` file):

`php composer.phar require zfr/zfr-rest:0.3.*`

Then, add the keys "ZfrRest" to your modules list in `application.config.php` file, and copy-paste the file
`zfr_rest.global.php.dist` into your `autoload` folder (don't forget to remove the .dist extension at the end!).

## ZfrRest vs Apigility

[Apigility](http://www.apigility.org) is a Zend Framework 2 API builder that also aims to simplify the creation of
REST APIs.

ZfrRest and Apigility philosophies are completely different. ZfrRest is Doctrine only, and focuses only on a very
small subset on your REST API: it provides routing, validation and hydration.

On the other hand, Apigility comes with a graphical user interface, versioning support, authorization, authentication
HAL, content negotiation... ZfrRest will never provide **all** those functionalities, so if you need them, just go
with Apigility.

ZfrRest's scope is much more limited (although I'd really like to add support for versioning and links), but I
really think it's a nice product too. So give it a try to both products, and choose the one you prefer!
