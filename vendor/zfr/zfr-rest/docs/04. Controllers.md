# Controllers

In this section, we'll cover more advanced concepts of the controller part in ZfrRest.

## Method handlers

A method handler is a specific object that implement the `ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\MethodHandler\MethodHandlerInterface`
interface. Its task is to perform some logic before and after passing the resource to the controller.

ZfrRest is bundled with handlers for all basic HTTP verbs: `DELETE`, `GET`, `OPTIONS`, `POST` and `PUT`.

Here is, for example, the delete handler:

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class DeleteHandler implements MethodHandlerInterface
{
    public function handleMethod(AbstractRestfulController $controller, ResourceInterface $resource)
    {
        // If no delete method is defined on the controller, then we cannot do anything
        if (!method_exists($controller, 'delete')) {
            throw new MethodNotAllowedException();
        }

        $result = $controller->delete($resource->getData(), $resource->getMetadata());

        // According to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.7, status code should
        // be 204 if nothing is returned
        if (empty($result)) {
            $controller->getResponse()->setStatusCode(204);
        }

        return $result;
    }
}
```

As you can see, the handler first checks if the `delete` method exists on your controller, and throw a
`MethodNotAllowedException` otherwise.

It then gives the resource (for instance, a User object) to your controller so that you can perform the logic of
deleting the resource. Then, it performs various checks to be as compliant as possible with various standards.

Some handlers are most complex, because they perform validation and hydration (for instance post and put handlers).

### Overriding existing handlers

If you want to override an existing handler to perform your own logic, you can altering the
`MethodHandlerPluginManager` configuration. In your config, add the following:

```php
return [
    'zfr_rest' => [
        'method_handlers' => [
            'invokables' => [
                'get' => 'Application\Handler\CustomGetHandler'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Adding handler for custom verbs

Alternatively, you can add support for custom HTTP verbs exactly the same way as outlines before:

```php
return [
    'zfr_rest' => [
        'method_handlers' => [
            'invokables' => [
                'funkyVerb' => 'Application\Handler\FunkyVerbHandler'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, you can have a `funkyVerb` method in your REST controllers, and it will be interpreted by ZfrRest.

## Configuring controller behaviours

By default, ZfrRest does a lot of things automatically for you. For instance, when doing a `POST` or `PUT` request,
it automatically validates the data and create a new object using a hydrator, so that your controller directly
receive a ready-to-consume object.

However, you may want to keep control on those steps, and doing the validation and hydration yourself. To that extent,
you can override two properties in controllers, namely `autoValidate` and `autoHydrate`. For instance:

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class PasswordResetListController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    protected $autoHydrate = false;

    public function post(array $data)
    {
        // For instance
        $passwordReset = $this->passwordResetService->createFromEmail($data['email']);

        return $this->resourceModel($passwordReset);
    }
}
```

With this config, ZfrRest will still validate data using the input filter from the mapping, however it won't
hydrate data. As a consequence, instead of receiving an object in your action, you will receive an array. This
is very handy when data coming from POST request needs heavy customization and cannot be mapped directly to an
entity!

You can configure those settings per controller, which make things extremely flexible!

> NOTE: By default, both `$autoValidate` and `$autoHydrate` are set to true. While there are a lot of use cases
where setting `autoHydrate` to false makes sense, it is not recommended to set `autoValidate` to false, because
you will receive potentially malicious data. It's therefore up to you to manually validate and filter your data
if you turn off this option!

## Context resource

When dealing with requests such as POST `/users/1/tweets`, you will receive a Tweet instance as the parameter
of the POST method in the tweet controller. However, you may need to have the context that was used to match
this resource. In this case, the user nÂ°1.

Because the router traverses the whole path, it keeps track of all the matched resources. ZfrRest controllers offer
a simple way to retrieve the previous matched resource (aka. the context) through the use of the `getContextResource`
method:

```php
class TweetListController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function post(Tweet $tweet)
    {
        $userResource = $this->getContextResource(); // $userResource is a \ZfrRest\Resource\ResourceInterface object
        $user = $userResource->getData();
    }
}
```

ZfrRest only supports going back one level in the hierarchy.

## Override controllers on associations

An association can be accessed on different paths. For instance, you may want to access the tweets from two different
paths: either accessing all the tweets using the `/tweets` URI, or accessing all the tweets from a given user using
the `/users/:id/tweets` URI.

However, you may often want to have different logic (permissions, rendering...) depending on the URI. To that extent,
you can use the `collectionController` on the association mapping:

```php
class User
{
    /**
     * @REST\Association(routable=true, collectionController="Tweet\Controller\UserTweetListController")
     */
    protected $tweets;
}
```

Now, the `/tweets` URL (if exposed) will be dispatched to the collection controller defined on the `Tweet` mapping,
but the `/users/4/tweets` will be dispatched to the `Tweet\Controller\UserTweetListController`.

> As of now, you cannot override the controller on association for single resource. This means that `/users/2/tweets/4`
will be dispatched to the controller defined on the `Resource` mapping of the Tweet entity.

## Configuring input filters based on context

Quite often, you need different validation rules depending on the HTTP method or things like users's permissions... For
instance, POST method for creating a user may require a first name, a last name and a password. However, you want
restrict updating (PUT method) to only password and last name, so that they cannot change their first name.

Zend Framework 2 input filters offer this feature through so-called validation groups. Validation groups allow to
skip unwanted values and do not return them. ZfrRest allows you to do this through a hook called `getInputFilter`
that you can override in your controller. This method is called by POST and PUT handlers. For instance:

```php
use Zend\InputFilter\InputFilterPluginManager;
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function getInputFilter(InputFilterPluginManager $manager, $inputFilterName)
    {
        $inputFilter = parent::getInputFilter($manager, $inputFilterName);

        $method = strtolower($this->request->getMethod());

        // We want to keep all the fields for POST, but limit them for PUT
        if ($method === 'put') {
            $inputFilter = $inputFilter->setValidationGroup(['last_name', 'password']);
        }

        return $inputFilter;
    }
}
```

What you receive is the input filter plugin manager (transferred to you by method handlers) as well as the
input filter name that was extracted from mapping.

You are not restricted to using validation groups. In some cases, you may need a completely different input filter,
because rules are dramatically different. You can do that too:

```php
use Zend\InputFilter\InputFilterPluginManager;
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function getInputFilter(InputFilterPluginManager $manager, $inputFilterName)
    {
        $method = strtolower($this->request->getMethod());

        // We want to keep all the fields for POST, but limit them for PUT
        if ($method === 'put') {
            $inputFilter = $manager->get('UserInputFilter');
        } else {
            $inputFilter = parent::getInputFilter($manager, $inputFilterName);
        }

        return $inputFilter;
    }
}
```

By doing this, you can avoid unnecessary instantiation of input filters.
