# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation.

## What is ZfrRest?

ZfrRest is a Zend Framework 2 module that allows you to easily create REST API using Doctrine common interfaces. It
is agnostic to any database (as of today, Doctrine 2 ORM is fully supported, and Doctrine MongoDB will be once it has
full support of the Criteria API).

## Understanding basic concepts of REST applications

REST (for *Representational State Transfer*) is an architectural pattern that take advantage of the HTTP protocol. It
expresses everything in term of "resources". A resource can be anything, from a user, a tweet, or a list of tweets.

## Current limitations

ZfrRest currently suffers from the following flaws:

* ZfrRest only support POST and PUT for single resource (you cannot bulk create or bulk update)
* ZfrRest only supports JSON output
* ManyToMany associations are not yet supported (ie. URI like http://example.com/countries/capitals)
