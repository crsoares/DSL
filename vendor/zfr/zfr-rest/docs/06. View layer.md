# View layer

ZfrRest provides a flexible way to automatically serialize resources. By default, ZfrRest ships with one renderer:

* `DefaultResourceRenderer`

By default, the `DefaultResourceRenderer` is registered.

## The `DefaultResourceRenderer`

This is the simplest and most efficient resource renderer. The only thing it does is extracting data from the
resource and encoding it to JSON. The following cases can happen:

* For a single item, it will use a hydrator to extract data.
* For a collection of items, it will use a hydrator to extract data from each item, and wrap the items
into a "data" key. If it detects that the collection is a Paginator, it will also output some details like the offset
or the total count.
* Everything is outputted into JSON.

This renderer is voluntarily simple, and does not output any complex things like links.

## Creating a custom renderer

If you want to create your own renderer, you just need to make sure your renderer implements the
`ZfrRest\View\Renderer\ResourceRendererInterface`. Then, you need to override the key in the service manager:

```php
return [
    'service_manager' => [
        'factories' => [
            'ZfrRest\View\Renderer\ResourceRenderer' => 'Application\Factory\CustomRendererFactory',
    ],
];
```
